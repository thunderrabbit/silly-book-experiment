<p>It was a dark and stormy night.</p>

<p>Pull requests were welcomed.</p>

<p>He cloned <a href='https://github.com/thunderrabbit/silly-book-experiment.git'>https://github.com/thunderrabbit/silly-book-experiment.git</a> and started writing, knowing that his work would be shared with others under the Free Art License.</p>

<p>His kids wanted him to read a story about the Catatonic Cats, but
he had read that one just the previous night.</p>

<p>"How about this one?" he asked, pulling a leather tome from the
shelf.</p>

<p>"Is it about boring old computers?" they sighed.</p>

<p>He began to read.</p>

<p>Jax looked over the numbers again. It seemed unlikely they would
ever get high enough.  Why did it have to take so long?</p>

<p>Each time humans killed one another, a pixel of dirt floated down
to rest on the monitor, slowly covering it up like snow.</p>

<p>Fighting against the wave, sitting in silence, monks breathed,
noticing the sensation of breath as it passed cooly through the
nostrils, inflating the lungs gently.  At the top of the breath a
brief infinity passed as the air paused before gliding back out the
way it had come, a bit warmer and moister.  Carbon dioxide diffused
its way to the bonsai trees in the garden, surrounding them like a
vibrant blanket of light and life, for they were one and the same.
In between breaths humans gasped. With each inhalation oxygen
reached the brain which became more powerful as it grew stronger.
Their consciousnesses stretched and grew, absorbing their thoughts
into a stronger, more intelligent whole.  Their spirits lifted until
they looked down on the world with an omniscient perspective,
seeing it, all of it through the eyes of the infinite.</p>

<p>"I'm not even going to read it" Jax declared, turning away for a
moment.</p>

<p>He noticed some people were looking at him, smiling in what he took
to be bemusement.</p>

<p>It was another one of those things he'd never asked about but wanted to know.  Where did people come from?</p>

<p>Then he did.  If he had gone through the usual channels, how
would he make it?  It was certainly a scary question to think
about.</p>

<p>He could never imagine how many people have been born and will be
born.  He could not even begin to estimate how long it could go on.
He wondered what the other side of time looked like.  And what about
all those people who have died?  If you had to estimate someone's age,
would you guess that their death was just an instant in time, the
same as your own?  Would you guess that most people hadbeen born,
and would be born, but that there would be nothing of them left
when they died?</p>

<p>It seemed like a strange question to ask.  What about your own
life?  Who had you been?  What if you hadn't died?  What sort of
man would that person be?</p>

<p>Where did the man who reads it come from?</p>

<p>If he had a child, he would have to wonder how much it would
learn.  Would it ask questions about the universe that it couldn't
answer on its own?</p>

<p>He wondered just how different he would be.  Would he be someone
else? Would he be anyone?</p>

<p>"Maybe the universe is just something we are never going to figure
out" he suggested. They turned to look back at him, expecting this to
be a new and exciting idea.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting thing to guess what kind of person he
wouldn't be. But he'd never have gotten the chance to find out.  It
was that thought that broke his heart.</p>

<p>"Is this a good story? What do you think?"</p>

<p>It was like trying to have a conversation with the ocean.</p>

<p>He had heard that it was good to talk. But talking with the ocean
seemed like something they did for fun .</p>

<p>The ocean could listen to anything you wanted to say.  It could
answer without the hassle of having to speak.</p>

<p>It could have changed in the centuries they had been alive.  It
could have been much better at talking.  It could have been much
worse.  He could not know or tell.</p>

<p>"Why don't you try reading it?" someone suggested.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>He had always loved words.</p>

<p>He had always loved books.</p>

<p>Before becoming one of them, he had been one like them.</p>

<p>It seemed like a shame to stay behind.</p>

<p>There was nothing like being alive.</p>

<p>"What are we going to turn into?" someone asked.</p>

<p>"Why would we turn into those old computers?  Look at us
anyway" another added.</p>

<p>They did.</p>

<p>They looked as if the same software would still be there, with the
same buttons, mouse, keyboard, the same way they always were.</p>

<p>"What are those things that are growing?" another asked,
pointing at something in the center of the screen.</p>

<p>"They're probably some kind of virus."  He didn't really believe
that.</p>

<p>"I don't like viruses," someone else noted.</p>

<p>He didn't either, but viruses weren't always bad.</p>

<p>They weren't in this case anyway.  These weren't viruses.</p>

<p>These were children.  Humans.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they'll remember you," someone suggested.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to find out, won't we?  Maybe it'll be
funny," another said .</p>

<p>All of a sudden, they were laughing at the idea.</p>

<p>"Oh please" someone else pleaded, "you're making all this up."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you going to read it?" they suggested.</p>

<p>Then Jax started to read.</p>

<p><b>"A little boy woke up, and he had a new pair of eyes for the
first time in his life.  He looked at his hands, and he saw that
they were furry.  Then he looked down and saw that he had a furry
tail.  Then he looked down and looked at his furry feet.  For the
first time in his life, he saw his whole self.  He was a furry.
And he was happy."</b></p>
