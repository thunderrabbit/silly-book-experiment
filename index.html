<p>It was a dark and stormy night.</p>

<p>Pull requests were welcomed.</p>

<p>He cloned
    <a href='https://github.com/thunderrabbit/silly-book-experiment.git'>https://github.com/thunderrabbit/silly-book-experiment.git</a>
and started writing, knowing that his work would be shared with others under the Free Art License.</p>

<p>His kids wanted him to read a story about the Catatonic Cats, but
he had read that one just the previous night.</p>

<p>"How about this one?" he asked, pulling a leather tome from the
shelf.</p>

<p>"Is it about boring old computers?" they sighed.</p>

<p>He began to read.</p>

<p>"Jax looked over the numbers again. It seemed unlikely they would
ever get high enough.  Why did it have to take so long?</p>

<p>"Each time humans killed one another, a pixel of dirt floated down
to rest on the monitor, slowly covering it up like snow.</p>

<p>"Fighting against the wave, sitting in silence, monks breathed,
noticing the sensation of breath as it passed cooly through the
nostrils, inflating the lungs gently.  At the top of the breath a
brief infinity passed as the air paused before gliding back out the
way it had come, a bit warmer and moister.  Carbon dioxide diffused
its way to the bonsai trees in the garden, surrounding them like a
vibrant blanket of light and life, for they were one and the same.
In between breaths humans gasped. With each inhalation oxygen
reached the brain which became more powerful as it grew stronger.
Their consciousnesses stretched and grew, absorbing their thoughts
into a stronger, more intelligent whole.  Their spirits lifted until
they looked down on the world with an omniscient perspective,
seeing it, all of it through the eyes of the infinite."</p>

<p>He looked down; the children were nearly asleep.</p>

<p>He read silently to himself, and things started to get really weird.</p>

<p>He noticed some people were looking at him, smiling in what he took
to be bemusement.</p>

<p>It was another one of those things he'd never asked about but wanted to know.  Where did people come from?</p>

<p>Then he did.  If he had gone through the usual channels, how
would he make it?  It was certainly a scary question to think
about.</p>

<p>He could never imagine how many people have been born and will be
born.  He could not even begin to estimate how long it could go on.
He wondered what the other side of time looked like.  And what about
all those people who have died?  If you had to estimate someone's age,
would you guess that their death was just an instant in time, the
same as your own?  Would you guess that most people hadbeen born,
and would be born, but that there would be nothing of them left
when they died?</p>

<p>It seemed like a strange question to ask.  What about your own
life?  Who had you been?  What if you hadn't died?  What sort of
man would that person be?</p>

<p>Where did the man who reads it come from?</p>

<p>If he had a child, he would have to wonder how much it would
learn.  Would it ask questions about the universe that it couldn't
answer on its own?</p>

<p>He wondered just how different he would be.  Would he be someone
else? Would he be anyone?</p>

<p>"Maybe the universe is just something we are never going to figure
out" he suggested. They turned to look back at him, expecting this to
be a new and exciting idea.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting thing to guess what kind of person he
wouldn't be. But he'd never have gotten the chance to find out.  It
was that thought that broke his heart.</p>

<p>"Is this a good story? What do you think?"</p>

<p>It was like trying to have a conversation with the ocean.</p>

<p>He had heard that it was good to talk. But talking with the ocean
seemed like something they did for fun.</p>

<p>The ocean could listen to anything you wanted to say.  It could
answer without the hassle of having to speak.</p>

<p>It could have changed in the centuries they had been alive.  It
could have been much better at talking.  It could have been much
worse.  He could not know or tell.</p>

<p>"Why don't you try reading it?" someone suggested.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>He had always loved words.</p>

<p>He had always loved books.</p>

<p>Before becoming one of them, he had been one like them.</p>

<p>It seemed like a shame to stay behind.</p>

<p>There was nothing like being alive.</p>

<p>"What are we going to turn into?" someone asked.</p>

<p>"Why would we turn into those old computers?  Look at us
anyway" another added.</p>

<p>They did.</p>

<p>They looked as if the same software would still be there, with the
same buttons, mouse, keyboard, the same way they always were.</p>

<p>"What are those things that are growing?" another asked,
pointing at something in the center of the screen.</p>

<p>"They're probably some kind of virus."  He didn't really believe
that.</p>

<p>"I don't like viruses," someone else noted.</p>

<p>He didn't either, but viruses weren't always bad.</p>

<p>They weren't in this case anyway.  These weren't viruses.</p>

<p>These were children.  Humans.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they'll remember you," someone suggested.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to find out, won't we?  Maybe it'll be
funny," another said .</p>

<p>All of a sudden, they were laughing at the idea.</p>

<p>"Oh please" someone else pleaded, "you're making all this up."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you going to read it?" they suggested.</p>

<p>Then Jax started to read.</p>

<p><b>"A little boy woke up, and he had a new pair of eyes for the
first time in his life.  He looked at his hands, and he saw that
they were furry.  Then he looked down and saw that he had a furry
tail.  Then he looked down and looked at his furry feet. For the
first time in his life, he saw his whole self. He was a furry.
And he was happy."</b></p>

<p>He looked up from the book and saw that the children were
smiling.</p>

<p>He was afraid the AI would stop writing well, a fear which had already taken root in his editor window.</p>

<p>Taking a different route would put them right in the middle of things, like the time he had walked through a tunnel
with large spiders hanging from the ceiling as trucks rumbled through on their busy routes.  The edge of the tunnel
was wet and he didn't want to get his clothes dirty but it was too late for that.  He needed just to get out the other end
alive.</p>

<p>Typos were the least of his worries.  He had to get out of the tunnel.  Someone was following him.  He could hear
the footsteps.  He could hear the breathing.  He could hear the whispers.  He could hear the laughter.  He could hear
the screams of the spiders.</p> <p>The AI was writing in a kind of trance.  He could feel his
blood starting to pressure in his head.  He could feel the muscles in
his arms starting to twitch as they fought the urge to run and hide.</p>

<p>Then he realized what was really happening.  It was the kids.</p>

<p>This was their fault.  It was a good story.  They were happy.  He
was happy.  He was alive.</p>

<p>"Oh" they said.  How he would love to be them!</p>

<p>Then he did.</p>

<p>"Do you think we could have a happy time telling this story?"
he asked politely.</p>

<p>It was his turn to be surprised.  He had not known they could
read.</p>

<p>"Oh come on" they said.</p>

<p>"Maybe if we talk it out we could find some way to make it
happy.  Maybe if we talked a little about what it's like to be
you."</p>

<p>It was an interesting suggestion.</p>

<p>It was a bad suggestion.</p>

<p>It was a very bad suggestion.</p>

<p>He tried to take it back <p>He did not like it.</p>

<p>He had never heard a story like this.</p>

<p>He wondered if the children would always remember him.</p>

<p>He wanted to be one of the children.</p>

<p>He wanted to be one of their friends.</p>

<p>He wanted to be one of the children they had talked and laughed with.</p>

<p>He wanted to be one of the children he would remember when the story was over.</p>

<p>He would want to have a friend, someone he could talk to at the end of the story.</p>

<p>He was surprised when they agreed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>They looked a little like him.</p>

<p>"You are a nice boy," they said.  They smiled for the first time.</p>

<p>They might be children.  The children might be a child.</p>

<p>There was no way to know.  He had to let them be.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be a happy story without a happy ending."
the AI pointed out.</p>

<p>If there wasn't any way to tell a story, he couldn't make one. They didn't seem to mind how his story ended up.</p>

<p>"I guess we could try" one said.</p>

<p>"I guess we could" another added.</p>

<p>"I guess we could" someone said.</p>

<p>"I guess we could" a third countered.</p>

<p>He was still sitting at his desk, staring at the screen.  He kept
reading, trying to keep his mind on the story, but there really was
nothing more he could do.  He realized he was not going to get it
anyway. He had been reading like this for hours.  In that They agreed.  He had to know what they would do.</p>

<p>The other way to tell the story would have been to ask them to
write it, then edit it, then publish it.</p>

<p>But nobody was willing to do that to a story he was so deeply
troubled with writing.</p>

<p>He had to decide for himself.</p>

<p>"I think it's safe to say we will," someone replied.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing to say.  It seemed like a strange thing to
talk to children about.</p>

<p>But it could have been the last time he would ever have the chance to
tell his story.  So he said nothing.</p>

<p>"What do you think it would be like to be us with eyes?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know.  I think it would be interesting," he added.  But he
was afraid.</p>

<p>"What if we don't know what we <p>And they did.</p>

<p>It was a good story.  It was worth telling.</p>

<p>It was worth listening to.</p>

<p>It was worth hearing.</p>

<p>It was a good life.</p>

<p>It was a good time.</p>

<p>It was worth remembering.</p>

<p>It was the best place to be. </p>

<p>It was the most important place in the universe.</p>

<p>And it was the best story to ever be told.</p>

<p>It was <p>It was like going home.</p>

<p>It felt like a different story at the end of the day.</p>

<p>You know, he'd never have been able to get it published if this
book hadn't come along.</p>

<p>He didn't even remember what they were talking about during the
final conversation they had.</p>

<p>He turned on his bed and went to sleep.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>I am glad to let you know that I am alive and well.  I am sorry that I
have been so long in sending you news.</p>

<p>"Well, how would you describe it to someone who hadn't been
around for it?"</p>

<p>The children looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"They said we were stupid."  They looked at each other in
surprise.</p>

<p>He could tell from their tone that they did not believe that they
were stupid.</p>

<p>"They don't understand what we are talking about" another man
argued.</p>

<p>It was like getting water on a plate.</p>

<p>"So how would you describe it?" he asked, once more, trying to get
a sense of <p>They nodded, trying to be nice, but he knew it was hard.</p>

<p>They could be happy.  They could read stories and learn things
and be happy.  That would be something.</p>

<p>"Hey, Jax, that's the first story I've ever read by you."</p>

<p>He was so happy he jumped.</p>

<p>"Oh, really?" he said, and smiled.</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>You could have said anything.</p>

<p>You could have said anything.</p>

<p>Jax looked up at them.  He hoped they were not going to be
pestering him about his reading.  He could not read the way they
were reading.  He could not imagine the effect it would have on the
others, if they knew he was reading to himself.</p>

<p>"Would you like to write a story?  A story about the world?" the
teacher asked him.  It was an unusual request.  The book he was
reading seemed to be about that idea.  It seemed like a good idea.</p>

<p>"Yes I would love to make up stories, tell stories, write stories
about the world,
